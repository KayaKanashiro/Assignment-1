#### The effect of reflection supported learning of writing on students' writing attitude and writing achievement goal orientations.
- This article focused on a study investigating how reflection-supported learning of writing affects students' writing attitudes and writing achievement goal orientations.
- The study compared two groups of students over an 8-week long period, the experimental group engaged in reflection-supported learning of writing, while the control group used conventional methods.
- During the study, both groups of students composed 6 paragraphs but the experimental group wrote reflections on each paragraph they produced, while the control group did not.
- The study found that students who engaged in reflection-supported learning of writing showed significant improvements in areas such as finding the writing enjoyable, feeling confident in their writing assignments, and believing in their competence as writers.
- The researchers who conducted the study suggest that their findings could be valuable for curriculum designers and course writers in incorporating reflection-supported learning into writing instruction.
